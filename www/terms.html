    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

    <h4>1.1. Legal Agreement</h4>

    <p>These Vapid.com Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”), together with such additional terms which specifically apply to some of our services and features as presented on the Vapid.com website(s) (“Vapid Website”, and collectively – the “Vapid Terms”), all set forth the entire terms and conditions applicable to each visitor or user (“User” our “you”) of the Vapid Website, the Vapid mobile application (the “Vapid App”), Vapid’s website hosting services and/or any other services, applications and features offered by us with respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services offered through the Vapid Website or the Vapid App, collectively – the “Vapid Services” or “Services”).</p>

    <p>The Vapid Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between Robbin & Company LLC and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries worldwide (“Vapid”, “us” or “we”) and you in relation to the use of any Vapid Services - so please read them carefully.</p>

    <p>You may visit and/or use the Vapid Services and/or the Vapid App only if you fully agree to the Vapid Terms - and by using and/or registering to any of the Vapid Services, you signify and affirm your informed consent to these Terms of Use and any other Vapid Terms applicable to your use of any Vapid Services. If you are using Vapid Services for an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use on behalf of that organization. If you do not read, fully understand and agree to the Vapid Terms, you must immediately leave the Vapid Website and avoid or discontinue all use of the Vapid Services.</p>

    <p>By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy available at <a href="/privacy">“Privacy Policy”</a>.</p>

    <h4>1.2. User Account</h4>

    <p>In order to access and use certain sections and features of the Vapid Services, you must first register and create an account with Vapid (“User Account”).</p>

    <p>If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the Vapid Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.</p>

    <p>You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the Vapid Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or if Vapid has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your User Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service or any portion thereof.</p> 

    <p>In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below.</p>

    <p>Vapid will consider the owner of a User Account, User Platform and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant Vapid Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in Vapid’s records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created.</p>

    <p>If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, Vapid will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“Billing Information”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain’s registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the www.whois.net website or on Vapid’s database, Vapid will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, Vapid will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, Vapid shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the Vapid Account as the owner of the User Platform.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the forgoing, Vapid shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event Vapid deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by Vapid.</p>

We encourage you to read our Privacy Policy and each such Third Party Services’ relevant policies on a regular basis, for a description of such data collection and use practices.</p>

    <h3>5. Service Fees</h3>

    <h4>5.1. Paid Services</h4>

    <p>The use of certain Vapid Services may be subject to payment of particular fees, as determined by Vapid in its sole discretion (“Paid Services” and “Fee(s)”, respectively). Vapid will provide notice of such Fees then in effect in relation to such Paid Services. If you wish to receive or use such Paid Services, you are required to pay all applicable Fees in advance.</p>

    <p>Vapid reserves the right to change its Fees at any time, upon notice to you if such change may affect your existing subscriptions. If you received a discount or other promotional offer, Vapid shall have the right to automatically and without notice renew your subscription to such Vapid Service(s) at the full applicable Fee.</p>

    <p>All Fees shall be deemed to be in U.S. Dollars, except as specifically stated otherwise in writing by Vapid. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by Vapid in writing), all Fees are exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities (“Taxes”), and you shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the Vapid Services, or to any payments or purchases made by you. If Vapid is obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the Invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third parties in connection with the purchase of Paid Services or in connection with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency exchange fees or fees due to banks or credit card companies). Vapid is not responsible for any such additional fees or costs.</p>

    <p>As part of registering or submitting information to receive Paid Services, you also authorize Vapid (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from our payment provider or your designated banking account, and to make any inquiries Vapid or its affiliates may consider necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from your payment, credit card or banking account provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by your credit card company).</p>

    <p>You may keep a credit card stored with Vapid to pay for Paid Services (“Stored Card”). You will be able to identify each Stored Card by its last four digits as in your Account Settings Page.</p>

    <h4>5.2. Current Fees for Plans</h4>

    <p>Vapid offers three monthly subscription options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$15.00 for 5 websites</li>
      <li>$35.000 for 20 websites</li>
      <li>$200.00 for unlimited websites and hosting services</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5.3. Invoices</h4>

    <p>Vapid and/or its affiliated companies will issue an invoice or credit memo for any payment of Fees or refund made to or by Vapid (“Invoice”). Each Invoice will be issued in electronic form and based on the country stated in your billing address, and will be made available to you via your User Account and/or by e-mail. For the purpose of issuing the Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain Personal Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) in order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice presented in your User Account may be inadequate with your local law requirements, and in such case may be used for pro forma purposes only.</p> 

    <h4>5.4. Subscription Auto-Renewals</h4>

    <p>In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services, certain Paid Services include an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, unless you turn-off  the auto-renewal option, such Paid Services will automatically renew upon the end of the applicable subscription period, for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period (excluding extended periods) and, unless otherwise notified to you, at the same price (subject to applicable Taxes changes and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the first period) (“Renewing Paid Services”). For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Accordingly, where applicable, Vapid will attempt to automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the Stored Card, within up-to two (2) weeks before such renewal period commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice.</p> 

    <p>By entering into this Agreement and by purchasing a Renewing Paid Service, you acknowledge and agree that the Renewing Paid Service shall automatically renew in accordance with the above terms.</p>  

    <p>You may turn-off the auto-renewal option or cancel your Renewing Paid Services at any time via your User Account.</p>

    <p>Certain domains are subject to a different renewal policy as detailed in the Domains Registration Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the Vapid Services you use (whether or not such Vapid Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals). Accordingly, you shall be solely responsible with respect to any discontinuation of any Vapid Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to charge the applicable recurring Fees, or due to any Vapid Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against Vapid in relation to the discontinuation of any Vapid Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.</p>

    <h4>5.5. Money-Back Guarantee</h4>

    <p>If you are not satisfied with Vapid Services that are subject to a Fee, you may provide notice of cancellation for any reason at any time. Refunds of monthly Fees will be prorated back to the date of cancellation. </p>

    <p>Please note: Certain services purchased on or through the Vapid Services may be non-refundable. These include Third Party Services such as domains, business tools and applications. The terms of each purchased service or application are indicated on the Vapid Website and/or as part of or during the process of purchasing such services or applications. It is your obligation to verify your ability to cancel a service prior to purchasing it. Vapid will not refund any amounts paid for non-refundable Paid Services, applications or Third Party Services.</p> 

    <h4>5.6. Chargebacks</h4>

    <p>If, at any time, we record a decline, chargeback or other rejection of a charge of any payable Fees on your Vapid account (“Chargeback”), this will be considered as a breach of your payment obligations hereunder, and your use of the Vapid Services may be automatically disabled or terminated.</p> 

    <p>In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in such User Account, including any domains, applications and Third Party Services may be subject to cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in Section 6.3 below). </p>

    <p>Your use of the Vapid Services will not resume until you re-subscribe for any such Vapid Services, and pay any applicable Fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by Vapid and/or any Third Party Services for each Chargeback received (including Fees for Vapid Services provided prior to the Chargeback, handling and processing charges and fees incurred by the payment processor).</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to Vapid, we encourage you to first contact our Customer Support team before filing a Chargeback or reversal of payment, in order to prevent the Vapid Services from being cancelled and your User Account being blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in your being liable for its applicable Fees, in addition to re-payment of all the Fees applicable to the Vapid Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.</p>

    <p>We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use of the services rendered thereafter.</p>

    <h3>6. Cancellation</h3>

    <p>If your User Account or any Vapid Services or Third Party Services related to your User Account are cancelled (whether at your request or at Vapid’s discretion), it may cause or result in the loss of certain content, features, or capacity of your User Account, including any User Content, End User data or other usage data retained therein, and including any domain name reservation or registration that was included in such Services (“Capacity Loss”). Vapid shall not be liable in any way for such Capacity Loss, or for saving a backup of your User Account, User Content or End User data. Please also note that additional Fees may apply to re-activation of a User Account and/or any Vapid Services following their cancellation, as determined by Vapid in its sole discretion.</p>

    <h3>7. E-Commerce </h3>

    <p>The Vapid Services also include certain features which enable you to sell goods, content, media and services through your User Platform (“User Products”, and collectively – “E-Commerce”).</p>

    <p>You are solely responsible for your User Products and E-Commerce related activities, and any promotions and related Content contained or referred to in your User Platform, and compliance with any laws applicable thereto. We are merely providing the platform for you to manage your online E-Commerce activities. We are not involved in your relationship and/or any transaction with any actual or potential buyer of your User Products. When someone purchases your User Products, such transaction’s payments will be processed through such third party payment service providers with which you decided to register and set up an account (“E-Commerce Service Provider(s)”), in accordance with such E-commerce Service Provider’s terms of service and other applicable policies. We are neither a party to nor are responsible in any way for your relationship with any such E-Commerce Service Providers, or for the actions of any of these E-Commerce Service Providers.</p>

    <p>By using any of our E-Commerce features, you acknowledge, warrant and agree that:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>You shall be solely and fully responsible for all Taxes and fees of any nature associated with your E-Commerce activities, including any Taxes related to the purchase or sale of the User Products, and to collect, report and remit the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities and/or inform your End Users of such and provide them with a duly issued invoice as required by law; </li>
      <li>Any Taxes indicated by the E-Commerce features provided to you by Vapid are solely provided for illustration purposes only, and may not be relied on in any way;</li>
      <li>You shall be responsible for and bear all costs of procuring and delivering your User Products, and for providing them in a safe and professional manner, consistent with industry standards;</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for any and all statements and promises you make and for all assistance, warranty and support regarding the User Products, and shall provide true contact information on your User Platform for any questions, complaints or claims; and</li>
      <li>You may not offer or sell any User Products, or provide any information, Content or material regarding User Products, which may be deemed hazardous, counterfeit, stolen, fraudulent, offensive or abusive; which are prohibited for sale, distribution or use; or which otherwise fail to comply with any applicable laws, including with respect to consumer rights, intellectual property or privacy rights, product safety, trade regulations and sanctions, support, maintenance and export; and –</li>
      <li>Vapid may, at any time and at its sole discretion, suspend, disable access to or remove your User Platform and/or any User Products - whether or not incorporated, published with or made a part of your User Platform at such time, without any liability to you or to any End Users, including for any Capacity Loss resulted therefrom.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>8. Third Party Services</h3>

    <p>The Vapid Services enable you to engage and procure certain third party services, products and tools for enhancing your User Platform and your overall user experience, including, without limitation, domain registrars from which you may purchase a domain name for your User Website, third party applications and widgets offered via the Vapid Website (including the Vapid App Market), third party Licensed Content, media distribution services, E-Commerce Service Providers, sellers of tangible products, third party designers who may assist you with your User Platform, etc. (collectively, “Third Party Services”).</p>

    <p>You acknowledge and agree that regardless of the manner in which such Third Party Services may be offered to you (bundled or integrated within certain Vapid Services, offered separately by Vapid or persons certified or authorized by Vapid, or otherwise offered anywhere on the Vapid Services), Vapid merely acts as an intermediary platform between you and such Third Party Services, and does not in any way endorse any such Third Party Services, or shall be in any way responsible or liable with respect thereto. Vapid will not be a party to, or in any way be responsible for monitoring, any interaction or transaction between you and any Third party Services.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge that such services may require the payment of additional amounts to Vapid and/or to the providers of such Third-Party Services.</p>

    <p>Any and all use of such Third Party Services shall be done solely at your own risk and responsibility, and may be subject to such legal and financial terms which govern such Third Party Services, which you are encouraged to review before engaging with them.</p>

    <p>While we hope to avoid such instances, Vapid may, at any time and at its sole discretion, suspend, disable access to or remove from your User Account, User Platform(s) and/or the Vapid Services, any Third Party Services – whether or not incorporated with or made part of your User Account and/or User Platform(s) at such time – without any liability to you or to any End Users.</p>
