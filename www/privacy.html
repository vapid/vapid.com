    <p>In the following instances, we collect and require you to actively submit Personal Information:</p>

    <h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>

    <p>We use Cookies and similar technologies to enable our systems to recognize your browser/device and to provide certain features. We also collect some Device Information and Usage Information using such technologies.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. A cookie may enable the website owner to track how a visitor navigates through its website and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals. Information gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site, and the website visited just before and just after a visit to our Services. Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period of time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off his/her Internet browser.  A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie.  Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies.<br><br>

        Our Services may use both “session cookies” and “permanent cookies.” Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit our Service or most websites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies.  For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        “Log files” track actions occurring on the Services, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
      </li>

      <li>
        “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Services.
      </li>
    </ol>

   <p>We also collect or receive various Usage Information and Device Information from third party analytics providers, such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Stripe and Twitter as well as from other advertising networks.</p>

   <p>You have a variety of tools available to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your Internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking certain non-strictly necessary cookies. Note that if you disable cookies, there may be parts of our Services that may not function properly.</p>

  <h3>COOKIE POLICY</h3>
 
  <p>We use cookies to help improve your experience of <a href="https://www.vapid.com">https://www.vapid.com</a>. This cookie policy is part of Robbin & Company LLC's privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between your device and our site. We also provide basic information on third-party services we may use, who may also use cookies as part of their service, though they are not covered by our policy. If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from <a href="https://www.vapid.com">https://www.vapid.com</a>, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired content and services.</p>

  <h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
 
  <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.<br>
  Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising, language).<br>
  Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typicallyonly track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>

  <h4>Types of cookies and how we use them</h4>

  <p>
    <strong>ESSENTIAL COOKIES</strong><br>
    Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins, account management, shopping carts and payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our website.</p>
 
  <p>
    <strong>PERFORMANCE COOKIES</strong><br>
    Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without
    collecting personal information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across all site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their audience’s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance cookies on our site.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES</strong><br>
    Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may
    configure on the website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites can provide you with customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>TARGETING/ADVERTISING COOKIES</strong><br>
    Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more relevant and
    appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.
  </p>

  <h4>Third-party cookies on our site</h4>

  <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites—for example, analytics providers and content partners. We grant these third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no control over third-party cookies, they are not covered by Robbin & Company LLC's cookie policy.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>OUR THIRD-PARTY PRIVACY PROMISE</strong><br>
    We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before enlisting their services to ensure their practices align with ours. We will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or violate the privacy of our users.</p>

  <h4>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h4>

  <p>
    If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.<br>
    If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.<br>
    Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.
  </p>
